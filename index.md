<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in [the Department of Industrial Engineering & Operations Research](https://ieor.columbia.edu) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), fortunately advised by Prof. [Henry Lam](https://www.columbia.edu/~khl2114/) and Prof. [Wenpin Tang](https://www.columbia.edu/~wt2319/). Piror to that, I earned my master's degree in Operations Research from Columbia and bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu).

My research interests primarily lie in (i) generative models, including large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, with a focus on RLHF; and (ii) efficient uncertainty quantification. I am also interested in designing efficient machine learning algorithms
with theoretical guarantees. Previously, I worked on efficient transformers and random features with Prof. [Krzysztof Choromanski](https://research.google/people/krzysztofchoromanski/).
