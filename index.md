<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a second year Ph.D. candidate at [the Department of Industrial Engineering & Operations Research](https://ieor.columbia.edu) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), working under the mentorship of Prof. [Henry Lam](https://www.columbia.edu/~khl2114/) and Prof. [Wenpin Tang](https://www.columbia.edu/~wt2319/). Piror to that, I obtained my master's degree in Operations Research at Columbia and bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu).

My current research interests focus on (i) generative models (LLMs and diffusion models), particularly on RLHF (ii) efficient
uncertainty quantification. I am also broadly interested in developing efficient machine learning algorithms
with guarantees. Previously, I worked on efficient transformers and random features with Prof. [Krzysztof Choromanski](https://research.google/people/krzysztofchoromanski/).
