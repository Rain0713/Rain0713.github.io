<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Physics Ph.D. candidate at [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/) and [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), working under the mentorship of Dr. [Ravelosona dafiné](https://www.spin-ion.com/about-us/), the director of research [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr) and CTO of [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/). My research involves magnetoelectric ("ME") materials for energy-efficient information technology and "ME" materials for data security in information technology using Multiferroics/Magneto-ionics/Surface charging, with a special focus on the boosting magneto-ionic effect using ion irradiation and implantation.
